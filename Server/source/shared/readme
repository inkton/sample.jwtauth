1. The projects are stored in a single git archive. the individual projects are split into different git branches. 

For example,
  
  app1-master
  shared-master
  worker1-master
  worker3-master

etc.    

2. Add shared folders into shared and push to the repository.

For example,

  shared/Docs
  shared/Utils

Then include the code in the project file as follows.

 <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
   <ItemGroup>
       <Compile Include="../shared/Utils/**\*.cs" />
   </ItemGroup>
   <ItemGroup>
       <ProjectReference Include="../shared/ToolsSet/ToolSet.csproj" />   
   </ItemGroup>
       ..
 </Project>

Make sure to commit and push to the repository before deployment.

3. Database and git. The Database folder will have 2 files when the Database is downloaded.

    - ddl.sql (SQL Schema)
    - dml.sql (SQL Data)

The SQL Data file is ignored by gitigore in the Database folder. Remove to store the data file in git.
